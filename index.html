                    <h2>What it is</h2>
                    <p>Prevent is the name given by the UK government to the safeguarding strategy designed to prevent
                        vulnerable people from being drawn into extremism of any kind. It isn't just about policing
                        people, and most referrals do not lead to any further police action. Often, referrals end up
                        with the person being signposted to other services that can help them with their problems, such
                        as health, mental health housing or education support.</p>
                    <p>Fundamentally, prevent is about engaging with communities to try and stop people from being drawn
                        into extremism and look after both those who are vulnerable, and those around them. All
                        referrals are handled sensitively and in confidence, which means reporting a concern will not
                        make you look bad, and if it turns out that the person you were worried about is not actually at
                        risk, it should not cause them any issues.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h2>Why it is important</h2>
                    <p>Sadly, terrorism and extremism have become something that effects us all. Prevent strategies aim
                        to try and stop more events from happening, and help people before they get radicalised further.
                        Particularly with social media, it is much easier for lies or misinformation to circulate very
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>If Prevent can stop even a single terrorist attack, it has succeeded. But more than that, prevent
                        tries to stop people from getting radicalised to the point that they would even consider
                        committing an act of terror, which saves their life too.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h2>What it should not be</h2>
                    <p>Despite the best of intentions, Prevent is not without controversy. There have been accusations
                        of racial profiling, stereotyping, and over-reach with regards to the powers it gives officers.
                        Some people think that it goes too far, and that some of the groups labelled as extremist should
                        not be.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h2>How to do it right</h2>
                    <p>Prevent is fundamentally about safeguarding. In the same ways you can become concerned about
                        someone not looking after themselves, or for having poor mental health, you can end up concerned
                        about radicalisation. Community engagement, talking to people, moderating online communities and
                        knowing who to talk to about your concerns are all ways you can help preventing horrible things
                        happening.</p>

                        views, but it can be harmful if they lead to violence or other illegal activities. What is
                        considered to be extremism can change over time, and different societies have different opinions
                        on what counts as an extremist view.</p>
