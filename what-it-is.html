                                    terrorism. Prevent also extends to

                                    be involved in, and the nature of their

                                    As an example, for those who work

                                    susceptible to radicalisation to terrorism,
                                    activity is most likely to be around
                                    identification and early intervention.
                                    Relevant factors may include
                                    relationships held with the person or the

                                    process, and people must give their
                                    consent before they receive support.
                                    In cases where the person is under 18
                                    years of age, consent is provided by a
                                    parent, guardian or the agency that has
                                    responsibility for their care. Where risks
